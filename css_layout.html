<h5>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h5>

<p class="static-position">In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal
    gardens faster: two same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled.
    The device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a
    sort of gliding walk.</p>
<p class="static-position">The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely of wood.
    This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation in any other place than a
    well maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.</p>
<p class="static-position">The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when pedals were applied
    directly to the front wheel. This machine was known as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone
    shaker," since it's wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an extremely
    uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in
    large cities.</p>

<h2>Relative Flow <span>position: relative</span></h2>
<h3>Relative positioning moves an
    element in relation to where it
    would have been in normal flow.
    For example, you can move it 10
    pixels lower than it would have
    been in normal flow or 20% to
    the right.</h3>

<h2>Absolute Flow <span>position: absolute</span></h2>
<h3>The box offset properties (top

    specify where the element

    <br />
<span style="display: inline-block; text-indent: 20px;"> position: absolute means something like "use top, right, bottom, left to position yourself in relation
to the nearest ancestor who has position: absolute or position: relative." </span>
