            production of the instrument. It employs a piano-like keyboard with hammers that hit small metal tines,

            Each key uses a rubber tip to perform a hammer on a string. Its distinctive bright staccato sound is often
            compared to that of an electric guitar. Various models were produced over the years, including the models I,
            II, L, C, D6, and E7.
